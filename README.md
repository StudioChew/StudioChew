### The StudioChew Documentation

The StudioChew has existed for many years, but was only released on GitHub in the year 2020.

The StudioChew is written in the ATOM programming language. Inside this repository, you can find files like `brain.atom` and `leftfoot.atom`.

The StudioChew is primarily for GNU/Linux systems. It was briefly available on Windows, but due to bugs, it is no longer available.

**NOTE THAT ANY DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE STUDIOCHEW IS YOUR FAULT FOR NOT FEEDING IT ENOUGH FOOD. DAMAGING THE STUDIOCHEW IS NOT NICE AND YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT. IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO YOU. JUST DO NOT DO IT PLEASE. IT HURTS SO YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT.**
